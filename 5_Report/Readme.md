# Water Tank Filler

## Introduction
In urban areas where water supplies are regulated to some specific period of time, person need to be present on that specific time to switch on their water pumps and store water in their water storage tank. If they are not present at that time then they have to pass through the hassle created due to no water. This project will intelligently (without need of any person) switch on the motor when municipal water supply comes and switch off the motor when storage tank gets filled.
Number of people turn on their motor and forget to switch it off, which causes wastage of water and electricity due to overflowing of water tank. This project will save water as well as electricity. According to MCD breeding of mosquitoes on terraces is largely due to contamination of water because of water overflowing. This will prevent breeding of mosquitoes This eliminates the need of physical presence of a person on time to switch on/off the water pump motor.
## Research
Water is the most important natural resources in humanâ€™s life. Human needs the water in almost all daily activities such as
washing, cleaning, taking a bath, the irrigation, and the industry needs. However, the amount of clean water is decreasing,
whereas the number of people in the world are always increasing. Considering to the need of water for each island in Indonesia,
especially Java island, Bali island, and Nusa Tenggara island, it can be analyzed that the clean water supply must be improved in
order to fulfill the people need of the clean water regularly.
The technology contributes to the culture changes. The technology is commonly made in order to help the people perform
some activities easy. Consequently, the cultural change is usually triggered by the technological transformation. One of the
present technologies is the automation technology. In some cases, the people sometimes want to carry out their work to be set
automatically so that they can save the energy to perform another activity. Some sophisticated automation materials have been
established in order to set some works automatically such Atmega328p microprocessor, which enable to control the electrical
circuits logically.
## Cost and Features and Timeline
### Features
- Switch off motor automatically
- avoid wastage of water  
- Doesn't require manpower to switch off the motor 
- Avoid breeding of mosquitoes on terrace
## SWOT ANALYSIS
## 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H
## Who
People turn on their motor and forget to switch it off, which causes wastage of water and electricity due to overflowing of water tank
## What
Human needs the water in almost all daily activities such as washing, cleaning, taking a bath, the irrigation, and the industry needs.
## When
Person need to be present on that specific time to switch on their water pumps and store water in their water storage tank
## Where
This can be used in Apartments,House,Storage tanks.
## How

## Detail requirements
## High Level Requirements
- Turn OFF the pump when the tank is filled.
- Turn ON the punp When water reaches the below bottom sensor.
- Prevent overflow of water.
## Low level Requirements
- Avoid overflow of water from the tank.
